Hey there, I'm JavaliKai!

I'm developing an e-commerce web application called "T-Shop" by using the MERN stack for practice. This web app uses [dummyproducts-api](https://dummyproducts-api.herokuapp.com/) as the product database provider (big thanks for the devs there). The functionalities are roughly the same as you would think of any e-commerce app features, such as: product queries, cart, favorites, product catalogs, accounts, and check-out procedure.

Any feedback will be appreciated!
